Division B - Technical Ops Trends Q1-Q2 2024
-------------------------------------------------------
- Sudden spike in ignored tickets from FinTech accounts during March.
- Tech department flagged increase in unresolved cases with D2C clients.
- B2C segment showed response time variance > 1800 seconds frequently.
- Teh escalation tracker reveals multiple entries for same user ID.
- Internal audit revealed timestamp anomalies (possibly timezone bugs).

Key Actions:
* Normalize timestamp formats
* Investigate duplicate ticket flows across escalation logs
* Enhance multi-level routing for support interactions

Conclusion: Actionable insights must be derived by linking notes + action history + response lags.
